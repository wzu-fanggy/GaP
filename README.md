# Crystal Structure and Property Prediction of Gallium Phosphide via a Generative Adversarial Network

This repository provides the **GAN model code** and the **GaP crystal structure dataset (CIF)**.  
The dataset was constructed via data augmentation based on the [Materials Project (MP)](https://materialsproject.org/) database and is released here in an accessible, downloadable form.

## 1. Repository Overview

### (A) GAN Project Code
This repository includes the GAN model code used in this work.

### (B) GaP Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **8 initial GaP seed structures** from the MP database (used as the starting point/baseline for augmentation),
- **9974 augmented crystal structure samples** (CIF files),
- **8 representative structures** reported/selected in the manuscript.
